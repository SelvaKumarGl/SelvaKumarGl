# Hi, I am Selvakumar :
As an aspiring data analyst set to graduate with a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in June 2024, I am deeply passionate about the transformative power of data.<br>Despite being a fresher, I bring to the table a blend of enthusiasm, practical experience, and a strong foundation in key analytical tools.<br>What sets me apart is my hands-on experience in real-life business projects where I've applied my skills in Excel,  SQL,  and Power BI to derive meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making. I possess a problem-solving mindset and enjoy finding new ways to use data to come up with solutions for tricky challenges.
